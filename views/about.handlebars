  <p class="lead">Starts ups don't have time to think about security. It is a dangerous risk they take everyday. SLAM
    is splunk for start ups who can't afford to pay millions for a logging tool.</p>
  <p>A survey in 2016 found that only 2% of Small business owners are seriously concerned with the threat of cyber
    attacks. Hackers know this! Which is why over half of cyber attacks are directed at Small businesses. Over 60% of
    Small Businesses who get hacked go bankrupt soon after. The majority of these attacks can be prevented through
    proactive log monitoring with tools like Splunk. Unfortunately, Splunk is inaccessible to most Small Business
    Owners due to price.</p>

  <h1 class="display-4">We use the ELK Stack</h1>
  <p class="lead">The ELK Stack is popular because it fulfills a need in the log analytics space. Splunk’s enterprise
    software has
    long been the market leader, but its numerous functionalities are increasingly not worth the expensive price —
    especially for smaller companies such as SaaS businesses and tech startups.

    For that reason, Splunk has the aforementioned small number of customers, while ELK is downloaded more times in a
    single month than Splunk’s total customer count — and many times over at that. ELK might not have all of the
    features of Splunk, but it does not need those analytical bells and whistles. ELK is a simple but robust log
    analysis platform that costs a fraction of the price.</p>
