security logging alerting monitoring
Contributions: Parsa Attari, Amir Shahatit, Rami Shahatit
Project from Inuit's Hackathon

In this project, we attempted to build a tool like splunk but for startups. It utilized the ELK stack to set up logging and would have custom alerting based on the ingested logs the startup/small business set up. It would advise actions that the company could perform to remediate the alert.
